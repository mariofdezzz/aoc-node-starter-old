This template pretends to unify Node.js users to make a quality tempalte for everybody to start easy and quick, adding most features possible for enthusiasts!

## ðŸš€ Start!
First **template** this repository. Then, easy as write `npm i` and `npm run start day1` on the command line (or whatever day you want). 

![Start example](https://github.com/mariofdezzz/aoc-template-sources/blob/main/init.gif?raw=true)

### Notes

- It is important to write the day as **one** word, or it won't work as expected.

- If it is your first time, **settings** will be displayed first.

## ðŸ›  README

What? Autogenerated readme? Sure! Type `npm run build`.

Your settings will be really meaningful here. Or you could just keep the calendar made out of the box.

You can watch the result [here](https://github.com/mariofdezzz/advent-of-code). Templates would be a nice feature!

## âš™ Settings
If you didn't like your first configuration, type `npm run init` and config will show up again for you. You won't loose any day done by doing it.
